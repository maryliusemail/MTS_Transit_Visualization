# MTS Transit: Navigating San Diego's Bus Network ðŸšŒ

## Project Overview
This project explores the structure and behavior of San Diegoâ€™s MTS bus network through data visualization and statistical analysis. By mapping the bus system and evaluating arrival intervals, the project highlights patterns in public transit service and examines assumptions often made in modeling passenger wait times.

## Objective
Visualize San Diego's bus lines and stops, using shapefiles and schedule data to reveal spatial patterns in the cityâ€™s transit network. Assess statistical properties of bus arrivals and analyze how they differ from theoretical models.

## Key Insight: The Waiting Time Paradox
Although real-world bus arrivals do not follow a Poisson process, average passenger wait times (6 minutes) are still close to average bus intervals (7 minutes). This reflects the Waiting Time Paradox, where passengers often experience longer-than-expected waits due to uneven intervals between buses.

## Real-World Implications
Bus schedules are optimized for regularity and reliability, not randomness. This project emphasizes the need to validate assumptions in data analysisâ€”real-world systems often defy clean theoretical models.

## Lessons Learned
- Be cautious when applying mathematical models to practical scenarios.
- Real transit systems may resemble theoretical processes only loosely.
- Data-driven visualizations can reveal hidden inefficiencies or unexpected insights.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **GeoPandas**: Handling and visualizing geospatial data.
- **Plotly**: Creating interactive visualizations.
- **Shapely**: Geometric operations on spatial data.
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting static graphs and maps.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive coding and documentation.
- **project-validation.py**: Script to validate project code against test cases.

## San Diego City Boundary Visualization

**Description**:  
Build a clean, organized bus schedule and map visualization for selected San Diego routes:
  - **`create_detailed_schedule`:** Combine schedule, stop, and trip data into a structured DataFrame showing the full stop sequence for each trip. Ensure routes are sorted properly and grouped by bus line.
  - **`visualize_bus_network`:** Plot the bus routes on an interactive map using Plotly, assigning each line a distinct color and enabling hover labels for bus stop names.

## Finding the optimal rounte

**Description**:   
Build a system to find the shortest bus route between two stops using a graph traversal approach:
  - **`find_neighbors`:** Identify all immediate next stops from a given station by looking across multiple bus trips and routes in the dataset.
  - **`bfs`:** Implement Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path (fewest stops) between a start and end station, returning an ordered list of stops with their coordinates.

## Waiting Time Paradox Visualization

**Description**:  
Simulate random bus arrival times over a day to explore the Waiting Time Paradox:
  - **`simulate_bus_arrivals_uniform`:** Generate random bus arrival times between 6 AM and midnight based on a given average arrival interval (`tau` minutes). Calculate the time gaps between each arrival to understand how real-world wait times differ from simple averages.

In a Poisson process, the time between events follows an exponential distributionâ€”shorter intervals are more frequent, but longer gaps still occur. This explains the Waiting Time Paradox: if you arrive at a random time, you're more likely to land within a longer interval between buses, which skews your average wait time higher than expected.

## Why the Bus Feels Late: Simulating and Visualizing Bus Transit Patterns

**Description**:   
Simulate and visualize how passenger wait times vary throughout the day to better understand the Waiting Time Paradox:
  - **`simulate_wait_times`:** Generate random passenger arrival times and calculate how long each person waits for the next bus. Return a DataFrame with each passengerâ€™s wait time and the bus they board.
  - **`visualize_wait_times`:** Create a Plotly visualization showing both bus and passenger arrivals over a selected one-hour window. Plot each passenger's wait time as a vertical line, helping illustrate how some passengers wait much longer than others due to randomness in arrival times.

![ScreenRecording2025-04-25at12 27 50PM-ezgif com-video-to-gif-converter](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d26af033-fc57-485a-815c-ef7d80e8ec26)

The Waiting Time Paradox occurs because when you arrive at a bus stop at a random time, you are more likely to land during a longer interval between buses. Longer intervals cover more time, increasing the chance that you find yourself waiting during one of these gaps.

This paradox helps explain why passengers frequently experience longer wait times than scheduled intervals would suggest.  
By simulating and visualizing bus arrivals and passenger waiting times within a specific one-hour window, we can see this phenomenon clearly â€” and better appreciate the hidden challenges of real-world transit systems.
